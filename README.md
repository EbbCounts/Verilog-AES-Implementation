# Verilog-AES-Implementation
Implementation of AES in Verilog and Python as the Final Project for Hardware Security 1. The goal of the project was to create a functional model of AES in Verilog, and then to recreate the model in Python to verify its functionality.

Here is an online AES calculator to verify the results of my project.
