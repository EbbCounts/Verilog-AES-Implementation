# AES Implementation in Verilog

This repository contains my final project for the Hardware Security 1 course, where I implemented the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption algorithm in Verilog.

## Project Overview

The main objective of this project was to:

- Develop a **functional AES encryption module in Verilog** suitable for hardware implementation.
- Verify the correctness of the design through test vectors and simulation.

## Project Details

- The Verilog module implements AES encryption based on the standard 128-bit key size.
- Testbenches were used to simulate and verify the functionality of the design.

## Verification

To verify the outputs, I used an online AES calculator available here:

[AES Online Calculator](https://testprotect.com/appendix/AEScalc)

This tool was useful to cross-check and confirm that the encryption results from my Verilog implementation were correct.

## Repository Structure

- `verilog/` – Contains the Verilog source code for AES.
- `testbenches/` – Testbench files for simulation of the Verilog module.
- `README.md` – This document.

## Usage

- Simulate the Verilog module using your preferred Verilog simulator with the provided testbenches.
- Cross-validate results with the online AES calculator linked above.
